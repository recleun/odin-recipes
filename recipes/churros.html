      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil water, sugar, salt, and vegetable oil. Remove from the heat, then stir in flour.</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a pastry bag and pipe into strips.</li>
      <li>Fry the strips in hot oil until they're golden.</li>
